Hi Andreas,

I hope you are well and the home office is just a precaution.

For the actual detectors we will need to define individual voltages for each anode channel. This is required in order to have uniform performance across the entire area. The other settings, like ramping speed and current limits can be shared by all anodes though. The two cathode stripes will also have different voltages, but otherwise will share a ramping speed and current limit. There is only a single window channel so this has a single set of parameters.

We don't know the final values for all the parameters yet, but an example configuration for the small detector could look something like:

Group: Anodes
Channels [0, 1, 2]
Voltages: [2075, 2100, 2085]
Ramp up: 2 V/s
Ramp down: 5 V/s
Current limit: 1 uA
Current trip time: 100 ms

Group: CathodeStripes
Channels: [4, 5]
Voltages: [75, 80]
Ramp up: 5 V/s
Ramp down: 10 V/s
Current limit: 1 uA
Current trip time: 100 ms

Group: Window
Channel: 7
Voltage: -1000
Ramp up: 2 V/s
Ramp down: 5 V/s
Current limit: 1 uA
Current trip time: 100 ms


For the large detector the only change in structure would be an increase in anode channels from 3 to 17.

For the 'Moving' condition, only the voltage on the anode wires needs to be changed and in this case a common voltage for all wires can be used - the ramping speed and current limits would be the same as those defined in the Anode group.

The transitions between different states (i.e. voltages off, on or in the Moving state) also need to be defined eventually. The rule we follow here is that the anode voltages should be off unless the window voltage is fully on.

Transition Off -> On
Step 1: Ramp up window voltage, wait until finished
Step 2: Ramp up anode voltages
Step 3: Ramp up cathode stripes

Transition On -> Off
Step 1: Ramp down anodes, wait until finished
Step 2: Ramp down cathode stripes
Step 3: Ramp down window

Transition On -> Moving
Ramp down anode voltages, wait until finished

Transition Moving -> On
Ramp up anode voltages, wait until finished

Transition Moving -> Off
Same as On -> Off
